<h1>PC Build:</h1>
	<p>I built my 1st PC for my cousins in the winter of 2016 and spent a total of around $500 using all 
	new parts and minimal specs in order to save money. I recorded myself and took pictures, it was 
	confusing connecting all the power supply cables to the motherboard, and as a 1st time builder I was 
	nervous of plugging in the wrong things. One of the hardest parts was picking parts but after I went 
	through much troubleshhoting I realized how easy it was.</p>
	<p>I decided to build my own PC but only got as far as a Case and power supply. I'm taking my time 
	building my PC and so far have gotten a total of $30 in rebates and decided to get the parts that 
	wouldn't change. Unfortunately Ram and GPU prices skyrocketed since 2016 Christmas and am stuck 
	waiting to get a good price on an RX-480 GPU and 16GB Ram</p>

<h2>Journals</h2>
	<p>I like to write short stories of anything that comes to my mind like a blog, I recently started 
	getting into FanFiction and suspense or Dark action. My most memorable and one that i will continue 
	to reserach isn't fiction but theory based on the Dimensions of Space and Time or String Theory. I 
	call it "11 Dimensions" and I simply explain in my own words how to visualize the concept of going 
	beyond the 3rd Dimension. It takes much thinking and imagination to picture what the 4th dimension 
	and beyond looks like and eventually logic takes the place of visuals</p>

<h3>Misc.:</h3>
	<p>I skateboard recreationally and think it's the best portable form of transportation</p>
	<p>I love to with Memes and Gifs and used to be pretty active on a website Memecenter, up until the 
	site became spammed with fake user accounts posting Gore and other unneccesary content. It was also 
	attacked by Redirects making the site basically inoperable. I haven't been as active on the site 
	since but it doesn't feel the same and the userbase seems to have died down</p>
