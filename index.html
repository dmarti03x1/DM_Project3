	<h3>Education Experience:</h3>
<p>I'm a 4th year student at IIT and originally transfred from a City college named Richard Daley 
College. I debated on going to Depaul or UIC a degree in cyber security but in the end chose IIT &amp;
I don't regret it.</p>
<p>I had no idea what studying IT would be like &amp; everyone else just assumes I would be fixing 
computers. My love for tech gravitated me towards I.T. but they're actually worlds apart for me. 
Before IIT my only I.T. classes where an intro to computers combined with learning Microsoft Office 
and a Visual Basic course</p>

	<h3>Origin:</h3>
<p>I'm a Chicago native born and raised in Bridgeport up until I was 17, I then lived in San Diego, 
California for a few months and lived in Oahu, HI for 4 years. Island life was good and I used to 
think I would be living out of a straw tiki hut with coconut tree's in the sand but island life was 
actually pretty normal like any other city. I came back to Chicago in 2013 for school.</p>
